The files in this folder are named after the HOST name of the machine they will be copied to as 'license.key' by the Capistrano deploy script
config/deploy.rb. Each machine needs its own license key from Rhosync in order to have more than 10 available devices.

If a new machine is added, a new key file from Rhosync should be added to this folder, named after that machine's HOST name. Then, if that machine
is added as a deploy target to the 'role :app' setting in deploy.rb, that machine's key will be copied from this folder to the 'settings' folder
and renamed to 'license.key'. 

For example, if you add a machine named 'nrhrho103' as a load-balanced target of rhosync.insphereis.net, first add 'nrhrho103' to the role
setting of deploy.rb:

    role :app, "nrhrho101", "nrhrho102", "nrhrho103"

Then get a new license for that box from Rhosync, rename to "nrhrho103" and add it to this folder.
